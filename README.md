# Vibron

Music apps all feel the same — so I built one that doesn’t.

[Vibron](https://vibron.vercel.app) is a web app that brings something fresh to how we experience music.

## What makes Vibron different?

### MOOD-BASED MUSIC  
Vibron uses your webcam to read your expressions and plays music based on how you feel — in your language. Whether you're happy, mellow, or just need a vibe boost, the playlist adapts to you.

### LISTEN TOGETHER  
Want to share the moment? Vibron lets you and your friends sync up and listen to the same music in real-time. Share playlists, discover new songs, and stay connected through sound.

Vibron is built to make music more personal — and more social.
